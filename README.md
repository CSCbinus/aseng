## Welcome to My World!

Aseng is a person who `weirdly` puts himself wandering in an Information Security. He loves to dig digital-cases especially those which are related into DFIR, Reverse-Engineering, and also some Exploit Developments.
He's also a CTF Enthusiast, HTB Player and a happy hoomans.

### How does he speak?

Currently, Aseng is fluently speaking in these languages ~
```python
#---------- SNAKES ----------#

import base64
print(base64.b64decode("SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"))
```
```C
//---------- SEA -------------//

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
  printf("Bello!");
 }
``` 
 ```assembly
 ;-------- AS-Semble ---------;
 
 BITS 64
 
 section .text
 global main
 
 main:
    mov rdx,len
    mov rsi,warm_welcome
    mov rdi,1
    mov rax,1
    syscall
 
 section .data
    warm_welcome: db "Hai!",10
    len equ $-warm_welcome
 
```


### Ready for some explorations?
