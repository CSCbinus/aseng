### How does he speak?

Currently, Aseng is fluently speaking in these languages ~
```

print(base64.b64decode("SGVsbG8gV29ybGQh"))

//---------- SEA -------------//

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
  printf("Bello!");
 }

 global main
 
 main:
    mov rdx,len
    mov rsi,warm_welcome
    mov rdi,1
    mov rax,1
    syscall
 
 section .data
